# Telestion

Telestion is a ground station software developed by the TelestionTeam for [WüSpace](https://www.wuespace.de/) projects.
We support space related projects by providing a generic ground station for commanding the projects and managing collected 
data. We help the teams during the whole project cycle starting at the development, continuing with a successful launch 
and ending with recovery and post flight analysis.

The ground station is based on a generic modular backend which is provided in this repository. 
The backend handles the data streams, holds the connection and provides interfaces to the experiments. 
The modular system is extended for the requirements of the experiments (e.g. 
[RocketSound](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-rocketsound)).

The frontend for visualising the data and commanding the experiment is located in the 
[client repository](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client).

Thank you to all contributors of this repository.
