# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.

# ******** NOTE ********
# If you need access to the GitHub Maven package registry from other repositories,
# create a personal access token with the following scopes:
# - read:packages
# and name it "READ_PACKAGES".
# After this step, overwrite the default GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable with the created PAT
# in the gradle build and test steps.
